# Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
*Coursera course by the University of Michigan*

## Overview

This repository showcases the foundational Python programming skills I gained through the Coursera course [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python). The course introduced core programming concepts, basic data structures, and techniques for working with files and simple data analysis.

## Key Skills and Concepts

1. **Basic Python Syntax and Data Types:**
   - Gained a solid understanding of Python’s syntax, including variables, data types, and control structures.
   - Practiced writing clean, readable code using standard conventions.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - Worked with lists, dictionaries, and tuples to store and manipulate data.
   - Applied built-in Python functions to efficiently process collections.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - Learned to write `if` statements, loops (`for` and `while`), and handle exceptions.
   - Gained proficiency in writing conditional logic to solve real-world problems.

4. **File Handling:**
   - Opened, read, and wrote text files to process structured data.
   - Used file I/O to parse and extract meaningful information from datasets.

5. **Basic Data Processing:**
   - Performed simple data analysis tasks, such as computing averages, finding patterns, and summarizing data.
   - Used Python’s standard libraries to manipulate strings and numbers.

6. **Program Structure:**
   - Organized code into reusable functions for better maintainability.
   - Learned how to design small, modular programs that perform well-defined tasks.

## Portfolio Contributions

By completing this course, I developed the foundational programming skills necessary for more advanced Python applications. The concepts and techniques learned here provide a strong base for further exploration into areas such as data analysis, web development, and software engineering. This repository demonstrates my ability to write Python programs that are efficient, clear, and capable of processing real-world data.
