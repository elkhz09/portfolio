# Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis
*Coursera course by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology*

## Overview

This repository showcases the projects and skills I developed while completing the Coursera course [Python and Statistics for Financial Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-statistics-financial-analysis). The course focuses on leveraging Python programming and statistical analysis techniques to solve real-world financial problems.

## Key Skills and Concepts

1. **Python Programming for Finance:**
   - Leveraged Python’s data manipulation libraries (`NumPy`, `pandas`) to clean, process, and analyze financial data.
   - Applied Python’s visualization libraries (`Matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to create insightful financial charts and visualizations.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize and understand financial datasets.
   - Used probability distributions and hypothesis testing to make data-driven financial decisions.

3. **Financial Data Analysis Techniques:**
   - Calculated key financial metrics (e.g., returns, volatility) from time-series data.
   - Analyzed relationships between different financial instruments using correlation and regression analysis.
   - Performed portfolio optimization and risk assessment.

4. **Hands-On Projects:**
   - Developed scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate end-to-end financial analysis.
   - Created financial models that forecast stock prices and evaluate investment strategies.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **NumPy:** For numerical computations and handling large datasets.  
- **pandas:** For data cleaning, aggregation, and time-series analysis.  
- **Matplotlib and seaborn:** For financial data visualization.  
- **SciPy and statsmodels:** For advanced statistical analysis.

## Portfolio Contributions

This repository demonstrates my ability to apply statistical and programming knowledge to real-world financial datasets. It highlights my proficiency in handling data pipelines, performing robust financial analysis, and presenting results in a clear, visual format.

By showcasing these skills and projects, I aim to demonstrate my readiness for roles in financial analytics, investment research, and data-driven decision-making.
